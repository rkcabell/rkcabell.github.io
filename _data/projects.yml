- name: Halvorsen Attractor
  description: Attractors are dynamical systems which show a set of states that tend to evolve to repeat a certain pattern. They display chaotic behavior that is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Although deterministic, two points with ever so slightly different starting positions or velocities may follow very different paths.
