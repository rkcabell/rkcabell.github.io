</div><div>Acidic water causes iron to leach. Dissolved oxygen turns Fe2+ into Fe3+ which precipitates out and forms layers in rock causing banding in rocks. This is a cycle that repeats.
</div><div>
</div><div>Water composition story:
</div><div>Acidic water causes organisms to create their own alkaline solutions for internal homeostasis. They surrounded themselves with a layer of alkaline liquid around their skin. At a critical point, vast swathes of these organisms die and cause build up of carbonates to precipitate into rocks. This is a repeating cycle that goes on for dozens of millions of years. During a tectonic event, worldwide tons of this material is dissolved into the water raising the pH by 0.5 every hundred years, causing a major extinction event.
</div><div>
</div><div>ChatGPT:
</div><div>In Dianthos's ancient oceans, teeming with life adapted to acidic conditions, organisms developed a unique survival mechanism: they produced their own solutions for internal homeostasis,and surrounded their skin with a layer of alkaline liquid, combating the corrosive nature of their environment. Zinc ions also helped their internal fluids to be inert to sulfide compounds. This biochemical innovation was widespread, marking a golden age of biodiversity in the planet’s harsh waters.
</div><div>However, this golden age had an expiration date. The relentless production of alkaline substances led to an unforeseen consequence: upon the death of these organisms, their remains—rich in carbonates—accumulated on the ocean floor. Over dozens of millions of years, this resulted in vast deposits of carbonate compounds, locked away in the sediment.
</div><div>The planet's restless nature eventually turned the tide of life. A cataclysmic tectonic event, stirring the very foundations of Dianthos, caused these ancient, carbonate-rich deposits to dissolve into the ocean waters on a global scale. This dissolution process initiated a slow but irreversible transformation of the planet’s oceans, raising the pH by 0.5 every hundred years or so.
</div><div>As the waters grew less acidic, the delicate balance that had allowed life to flourish under acidic conditions was undone. Ecosystems that had taken millions of years to evolve were decimated, leading to a major extinction event. New niches emerged, favoring organisms that could thrive in the shifting chemical seascape, laying the groundwork for a new era of evolution on Dianthos.
